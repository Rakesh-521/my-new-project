# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Building AI is a flexible online course for anyone who wants to learn about the practical methods that make artificial intelligence a reality. You will get a solid introduction to for example machine learning and neural networks, and you will learn where and how AI methods are applied in real life. 


## Background

Building AI involves creating and developing artificial intelligence systems or models that can perform specific tasks or exhibit intelligent behavior. The process typically includes several key steps:

1. Define the problem: Identify the specific task or challenge that the AI system will address. This involves understanding the problem domain and defining the objectives clearly.

2. Data collection: Gathering relevant and diverse data is essential for training the AI model. High-quality data is crucial for the model to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

3. Data preprocessing: Before feeding the data to the AI model, it needs to be cleaned, formatted, and transformed into a suitable representation for training.

4. Model selection: Choose the appropriate AI model or algorithm that best suits the problem at hand. This could be deep learning models like neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.

5. Model training: During this phase, the AI model is fed with the preprocessed data to learn from it. The model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors and improve its performance.

6. Model evaluation: Assess the AI model's performance on a separate set of data (validation set) to measure its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

7. Deployment: Implement the trained AI model in real-world applications to carry out the intended task.

8. Monitoring and improvement: Continuously monitor the AI system's performance in the deployed environment and make necessary adjustments or updates to improve its effectiveness.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Navie Bayes
* Regression
* etc.


## How is it used?

The goals of artificial intelligence include computer-enhanced learning, reasoning, and perception. AI is being used today across different industries from finance to healthcare. Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
